Employee attrition is a gradual but deliberate reduction in the number of employees in a company or business organization. Employees will at some point in time look to change their job places for a number of reasons. It might be for professional or personal reasons but it does happen.


Types of Employee Attrition
Retirement
It is normal for one or two people to retire from your organization in a year. If you count that as attrition, then it means you will not be able to correctly define employee attrition. One or two persons is not large enough statistically for you to consider as attrition. Based on the attrition definition, you have a problem only if they retire in large numbers around the same period. To avoid this type of employee attrition, it’s important that you have a mix of age grades among your employees.

Voluntary attrition
If you can answer the question, ‘what does attrition mean?’ Then, you will understand that this type of attrition is a very common one. Here, the employees are the ones that quit voluntarily. There are a number of reasons for a high employee attrition rate, but most of them are within your control as a business owner or employer. So, you must ensure that you take steps into ensuring that you prevent voluntary attrition in your organization.

This can lead to a reduction in the level of productivity in your organization. To avoid this type of attrition, you must put the right structures in place to make your employees believe that your company is the right place for their personal development.

Involuntary attrition
If you are going to talk about attrition in business definition, then this type of attrition is not dependent on the employees. In this case, the employers or organization are the ones who initiate the attrition. It might be that they sack a number of employees because of misconduct at their work. Sometimes, this can also be due to structural reasons. A common structural reason for employee attrition is an acquisition or a merger.

To avoid involuntary attrition, your onboarding process has to be strict enough to ensure that you bring in only the best talent.

Internal attrition 
This is a case where employees quit one department for another within an organization. You can use this to determine the best job placement for employees in your company. However, you also have to be watchful. It calls for investigation if the attrition rates of a department are very high in one year. You have to ask what is wrong with that department.

What are the heads of the department doing wrongly? Making sure that all departments are active and productive will reduce internal attrition.

Demographic attrition
This is the type of attrition that is specific to a particular group. It could be people living with disabilities, ethnic minorities, veterans and old professionals, or even women. When a particular demographic group starts to exit your company in large numbers, then it is time for you to review your company’s policy.
